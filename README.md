# Electrical-power-consumption-PANDAS-

In this project we explore a dataset where we have power consumption for three zones over 10 mins increments. So first we average this to hourly basis to wok with. It appears that power consumption follow a repeating pattern for all the three zones where the power consumption peaks around 7:00 PM ~ 9:00 PM and is lowest around 5:00 AM ~ 7:00 AM everyday.
